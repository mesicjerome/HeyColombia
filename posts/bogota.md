Don’t be intimidated by the sprawling, bustling city of Bogotá. Colombia’s capital is truly historic and packed with touristy things to do, but it’s also got a cool, hip, and even chic side to it as well. From its weekly Ciclovía bike route through the streets to its upscale neighborhoods filled with great restaurants, parks, and excellent nightlife, Bogotá is a real cosmopolitan city.

At the same time though, you’ll love all of the authentic culture, markets, and street art that you’re surrounded by on a daily basis. And after you’ve explored La Candelaria all the way up through Zona Rosa, you can head out of town for some day trips to colonial villages, beautiful lakes, and dramatic waterfalls.


## 1. The Gold Museum
Bogotá’s Museo del Oro is the most popular (and possibly the most interesting) museum in the city, and it’s home to more than 30,000 pieces of gold.
There are three floors filled with artifacts collected from Colombia’s pre-Hispanic cultures, each focusing on a different theme.
Learn how these people discovered, mined, and then worked the metals, making jewelry, masks, bowls, offerings, and armor.

Discover the symbolism and spiritual aspects of gold’s everyday uses.
The whole museum is very well done and absolutely stunning, plus the entrance fee is small for this dramatic and detailed look into the past.

## 2. The Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá
One of the most popular day trips from Bogotá, the Salt Cathedral is located in the town of Zipaquirá about an hour outside the city.
This whole cathedral was carved deep underground in a salt mine, and it contains alcoves for worshipping and beautifully lit crosses.
It’s huge too, like a small town set 590 feet (180 meters) beneath the earth with places to eat and buy trinkets as well.

Get here early to beat the crowds, sign up for one of the frequent tours, and take some time to explore the colonial town nearby once you’re done.

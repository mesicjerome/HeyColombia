One of the most gorgeous, romantic, and colorful cities in the world, Cartagena is packed with history, friendly Colombians, and of course, tourists. The walled city is made up of pastel colonial buildings lined with flowers, cobblestone streets, horse carriages, and plenty of restaurants and boutiques to satisfy all of its many visitors.

You can walk the city walls during sunset, explore the fortress that’s been protecting the city for hundreds of years, and try all of the area’s Caribbean cuisine, from fresh fish to exotic fruits. Between markets, day trips, shopping, and the nearby beaches and Rosario Islands, you’ll be marveling at Cartagena’s beauty for days on end.

## 1. Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas
This might be the most incredible fortress ever built by the Spanish in any of their colonies and it’s a landmark within the city of Cartagena.
Construction began in 1639, and it’s never been taken despite numerous attempts to attack the city.
There are tunnels within it specifically designed to allow even small sounds to travel well so that any intruders would be detected easily.
You can stroll through some of these dark passageways and make your way along the fort’s walls and battlements when you visit.
Grab a guide or one of the audio tour headsets to learn more about its history.

## 2. Sunset Drinks at Cafe del Mar
This restaurant is one of the most popular in the city because of it’s prime location.
It’s situated along the walls of the old city and it’s the perfect place to watch the sun go down while sitting outside overlooking the Caribbean Sea.
Of course, the prices here are higher than most in the city due to this amazing real estate, but the cocktails are great.
Get there early or book a table in advance because it gets crowded.
There’s a huge Colombian flag on the patio so the photo opps here can’t be beat, and there’s usually a breeze and some kind of live music to enjoy after a hot day in Cartagena.

## 3. Bocagrande Beaches
If you can’t make it out to the Islas del Rosario or Playa Blanca then head to the beach in the city.
This neighborhood is filled with more tall apartment buildings and condos than pastel colonial homes, but it’s still worth a look.
It’s got the longest and most accessible beach in the city, and along the the main avenue you’ll find big hotel chains and casinos reminiscent of Miami.
The beach is a great place to relax if you’re capable of saying no to the constant vendors and women offering massages.
It’s not a picture-perfect Caribbean beach as the sand is dark, but the water is clear and there are plenty of restaurants where you can grab a bite or rent a beach chair.

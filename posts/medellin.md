The second city of Colombia, Medellín has transformed itself perhaps more than any other city in the world. Though its violent, tumultuous past is well-known, today the city is modern, innovative, and just generally lovely.

Nicknamed the “City of Eternal Spring” for its nearly perfect weather, you’ll find plenty of parks and plazas where you can enjoy the sunshine with a fresh juice from a street food vendor and a couple of empanadas.

Make sure you learn all about the city’s past in order to appreciate how far it’s come – there are plenty of museums and tours that’ll educate you, along with authentic markets and neighborhoods to explore. The city is also home to great restaurants, cafes, bars, and even clubs that’ll have you salsa dancing the night away… or trying to anyway.

## 1. Bandeja Paisa
If you don’t know much about Colombian food, Medellín is the perfect place to get acquainted.
From the many exotic fruits to mondongo (tripe soup) to cheese-filled arepas, you’ll have no shortage of options.
The one thing you must try here is the local specialty, bandeja paisa, a gut-busting combination of meats like sausage and pork cracklings alongside beans, plantains, rice, a fried egg, and a few avocado slices they’ve thrown in for good measure.
Hatoviejo, Hacienda Junin, and Mondongo’s are all great places to try local cuisine.

## 2. Museo de Antioquia
A former city hall turned museum, this place houses a great collection of works by Fernando Botero.

He’s one of Colombia’s most famous artists, and he had a penchant for painting all things chubby.
Born in Medellín, the artist patronized his hometown museum by donating many of the works himself.
Guides recommend starting on the top floor with his earlier pieces and making your way down to see his evolution as an artist.
The museum also houses works by international artists and offers an audio guide if you want to learn even more.
There’s a small cafe and courtyard here where you can take a break.

## 3. The Botanical Gardens
A natural oasis in the center of Medellín, they city’s botanical gardens contain more than 1,000 species of wildlife and 4,500 flowers.
There’s a butterfly garden, a cactus garden, and a huge collection of orchids.
Entry is free and you can go explore the area to find critters or just lie on the grass in the sun with a book.
There’s even a 65-foot-high wooden mesh structure called the Orquideorama which collects rainwater and protects the orchids and butterflies below.
Have a picnic, check for live events, and be sure to visit if you’re here during the city’s Festival of the Flowers, it’ll be even more impressive.

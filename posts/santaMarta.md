## 1. Tayrona Park
The biggest draw of any visit to Santa Marta is a trip to the nearby protected national park of Tayrona.
It’s located right on the coast with many square miles of forested mountains and multiple beaches.
The lush green landscape is teeming with biodiversity, and you’ll see birds, monkeys, leaf cutter ants, and maybe even sloths on your way in.
You can arrive via public bus from the city and then hike all the way to viewpoints, jungle trails, and beaches.
It’s worth it to spend the night since the walk in takes so long.
Rent a hammock or a tent and camp out at Cabo San Juan – it’s rustic but incredible! You could also ride a horse into the park or negotiate with a boat to drop you off from Taganga.
You’ll find beach restaurants here selling fried fish, rice, and cold beers.

Remember to bring mosquito repellant, good shoes, and sunscreen.

## 2. Taste the Caribbean Cuisine and Street Food
Santa Marta’s streets are packed with vendors selling phenomenally cheap and fresh local food.
After you’ve had your fill of fried fish and arroz de coco (coconut rice), grab a styrofoam cup of Colombian ceviche – the addition of ketchup to the mix is interesting! There’s a plethora of fresh fruit and juices, so be sure to try things you can’t get at home, like lulo and maracuya.
The seafood is excellent, from pargo (snapper) to langostinos (warm water lobsters), and the cazuela de mariscos (seafood stew) is delicious and affordable.
Try the grilled chorizo and fried potatoes you’ll find around the Éxito supermarket too! For some gourmet arepas, hit up Lulo.

## 3. Paseo El Camellon
Santa Marta’s palm tree-lined waterfront promenade runs from the old port to the new marina.
It’s worth a stroll – especially at sunset – to grab a drink or a snack while you check out the views over the water.
Along Avenida Las Bastidas, you’ll find men selling ceviche and arepas as well as sweets, fresh coconuts, and tropical fruits.
Tourists seem to love posing with the statues of the larger-than-life indigenous figures here, and you’ll even see some locals swimming here.
Nearby you’ll find the governor’s house, craft stores, and a few nice restaurants.
